# Customer Segmentation
**Customer segmentation** is the process of dividing a customer base into groups of individuals who are similar in specific ways relevant to marketing, such as demographics, behaviors, or preferences. 

The purpose of segmentation is to better understand and target customers in order to improve marketing effectiveness, customer satisfaction, and ultimately, business performance.

## RFM analysis
**RFM analysis** is a method used for customer segmentation based on their past purchasing behavior. RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value:

**Recency (R):** This refers to how recently a customer has made a purchase. Customers who have made purchases more recently are likely to be more engaged and responsive to marketing efforts.

**Frequency (F):** This measures how often a customer makes purchases. Customers who make frequent purchases are more likely to be loyal and valuable.

**Monetary Value (M)**: This reflects how much money a customer has spent. Customers who have spent more money are generally more valuable to the business.

In this analysis, the each of these three factors are scored on a scale of 1-4. Then the scores are combined to create 10 segments of customers. Higher the score of the customer segment more profitable they are for the business.

**Guideline for scoring:*

The profitable customers should have low recency and high frequency and monetary value. Therefore, the recency score will be more when recency is low and frequency and monetary scores will be high when frequency and monetary values are high.
